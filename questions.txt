1. initial value: empty
 24 bytes added
3 at top of stack
2 second value
 
1 2 in rbx

My hypotheses were correct for this

2. adress is 0x8B052

   content of address is nothing

  actul values ended up being completely different from guess.

3. nothing at top of stack
   address is 0x0

   current stack pointer is 0x1

 actual values ended up being completely different.

4. THey are in different states

  actual states were indeed different.
